* Hi!

I'm glad you made it to my page. I'm a physicist and data scientist, currently living in Fortaleza, Brazil. I like science in general, functional programming, languages, and solving problems. 

You can check my [[http://vsantos.me/][personal page]] or get in touch, I would love to hear from you. I am a native Portuguese (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·) speaker and speak English (ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸) fluently.
